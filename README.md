# Reel RendezVous Client
Reel RendezVous is a SPA that integrates both client-side and server-side development. Reel RendezVous provides users with a bank of movie knowledge, all accessible through a UI built using React.

## Requirements

[React](https://react.dev/)
- React is an open-source frontend library focused on code reusibility through the use of components. By allowing HTML-like syntax, nestled in JS, React significantly reduces the amount of code needed to build out your frontend. 

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) 
- Parcel is a tool that tracks all files, dev dependencies, configurations and more being used during a build. Additioanlly, Parcel will invalidate the cache after any new changes.

## Setup & Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncMyShip/myFlix-client.git
cd mfFlix-client
npm install
npm start
```
Once the application is running, navigate to `http:localhose:<port>`. The `<port>` can be found written to your console upon setup.
